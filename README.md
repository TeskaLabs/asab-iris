## üé® Template Storage and Usage

In the enchanting world of ASAB Iris, templates (especially those crafty Jinja ones) are the spells you cast to conjure up dynamic content for various communication channels like email and Slack.

**Storage Warning:**
Keep your templates in these sacred vaults or the mighty Templates node in Zookeeper, so they're ready for your next spell.

**Directory Structure:**
- `/Templates/Email/`: For your email incantations.
- `/Templates/Slack/`: For Slack spell-casting.
- `/Templates/MSTeams/`: For Microsoft Teams magic
- `/Templates/General/`: For your everyday sorcery.

**Explanation:**
- **Variables**: Your spell components (e.g., `{{ username }}`).
- **Control Statements**: Incantations for content control (like `if` and `for`).
- **Filters**: Magical modifiers for your variables.
- **Inheritance**: Keep your spellbook organized with a master grimoire and supplementary scrolls.

Remember, a tidy spellbook is a mighty spellbook! Store those templates wisely! üìú‚ú®
